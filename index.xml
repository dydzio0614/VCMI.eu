      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re back with new major release! A lot of work has been done to ensure game stability. A number of &amp;ldquo;impossible&amp;rdquo; crash bugs were tracked down and fixed. This opens up chance for better multiplayer support in the future. RMG has undergone huge improvement, it is now not only closely resembling OH3, but also works much faster. Bonus is about 150 random map templates ported from original game and fan favourites.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re happy to give you new version VCMI 0.98. Previous release 0.97 was not very satisfactory, it has a number of issues with AI as well as crashbugs. Luckily now all these problems are solved and you can play new VCMI 0.98 with no problems.
Finally all the spells in game are supported. New additions include missing adventure spells and Earthquake. An important new feature is World View option. You will also notice nice fading effect on picked treasures and adventure map transitions.</description>
